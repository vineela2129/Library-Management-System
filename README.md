In today's digital age, efficient management of library resources is crucial for enhancing accessibility and user satisfaction. A Library Management System (LMS) serves as a vital tool in automating and streamlining library operations, ranging from cataloging and circulation to member management and resource monitoring. By centralizing these tasks, the LMS aims to optimize the utilization of library resources and improve the overall user experience.
